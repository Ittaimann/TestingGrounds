blend syntax/ semantics

blend {var1} {var2}

var1 is the alpha channel of whatever was returned via youir fragment shader
var2 handles whatever had exsisted behind or previous to the current element

To ensure proper transparency you need to make sure that the object is being rendered LATER IN THE DRAW
to do thiswe set its render queue to transparent in tags
Tag {"Queue"="Transparent"}

THis will achieve a very simple transparecny effect, however anything more than that will require much more work.
